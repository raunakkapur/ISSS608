## Objective

In this exercise, we will pick up 2 participants based on a relevant criteria and understand their daily routine activities.

## Reading the package

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
packages = c('scales', 'viridis', 'animation','plotly','CGPfunctions',
             'lubridate', 'ggthemes', 'gganimate','quantmod',
             'gridExtra', 'tidyverse','patchwork','ggHoriPlot',
             'readxl', 'knitr','plotly','hrbrthemes','ggrepel',
             'data.table', 'ViSiElse','rmarkdown')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}

```


## Who are the lucky ones?

```{r}
ParticipantsList=read_csv("data/Participants.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
paged_table(ParticipantsList)
```

For our study, we can pick up 2 participants - The one who is quoted as the <b>happiest</b> one, and the one whose joviality equals the median of the dataset.

```{r}
happiest<-ParticipantsList%>%
  select(participantId,haveKids,joviality)%>%
  filter((joviality==max(joviality) | joviality==median(joviality)))
paged_table(happiest)

```

Looking at the data set, we can set our objective as - <b><i>What makes the happiest person happy?</b></i>

## Data Cleaning

The files provided to us contain huge number of records. As a next step, we will perform the following process:-

1. Combine all the files by using the map function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
logs_fread <- list.files(path = "~/Desktop/SMU/Courses/Visual Analytics/Data/VAST-Challenge-2022/Datasets/ActivityLogs/",
                  pattern = "*.csv", 
                  full.names = T) %>% 
  map_df(~fread(.))
```

2. Save them in the RDS format

```{r eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(logs_fread, 'data/logs_fread.rds')
```

3. Read the RDS file

```{r eval=FALSE}
participants <- readRDS('data/logs_fread.rds')
```
 

4. Now that we have our participants, we can filter them out from the RDS file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
selectedParticipants<-participants%>%
  filter(participantId==113 | participantId == 320)
```
5. Saving the filtered records in csv file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fwrite(selectedParticipants, "data/SelectedParticipantsLog.csv")
```

6. This file now becomes our base file/input file on which we can perform our analysis.

```{r}
FilteredLog=read_csv("data/SelectedParticipantsLog.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)%>%select(-currentLocation)
paged_table(FilteredLog)
```

## Visualization

### An average day of our participants

#### Data cleaning

1. Adding a start time and end time against each of the participants. 

```{r}
StartEndTime<-FilteredLog%>%
  mutate(Date=date(timestamp),
    StartTime=format(timestamp,"%H:%M:%S"),
         EndTime=timestamp+(5*60))
paged_table(StartEndTime)
```

```{r}
StartEndTime%>%filter(Date=="2022-03-01" | Date=="2022-03-05")
```

#### Visualization

Choosing 01-03-2022 as our weekday and 05-05-2022 as weekend

```{r fig.width=10}

DailyGraph320<-ggplot(StartEndTime%>%
                        filter(Date=="2022-03-01"),
                      aes(x=timestamp, xend=EndTime, y=currentMode, yend=currentMode,color=sleepStatus,group=currentMode)) +
  geom_segment(aes(group = seq_along(timestamp)),size=5)+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Time")+
  ylab("Location")+
  ggtitle("An average weekday")+
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Sleep Status"))+
  facet_wrap(~participantId,nrow = 2)+
  transition_reveal(timestamp)
DailyGraph320<-animate(DailyGraph320,duration = 15)
DailyGraph320
```

<b>Knowledge</b>
<ul>
<li>Part. 113 prioritizes sleep and sleeps for optimum duration</li>
<li>Part 113 spends a considerable amount of time on recreational activities preparing herself for the next day ahead </li>
<li>Part. 113 seems to be a morning person as she reaches her work place on time and completes a major portion of her work during the day. While Part. 320 on the other hand, seems to be a post lunch person as he pulls off a major portion during post lunch.</li>
</ul>
<b>Wisdom: </b> Sleep and recreational activities help rejuvenate and can lead to a happier life. Also starting off work early can wrap it as soon as possible and thus, can lead to a better work-life balance.


```{r fig.width=10}

DailyGraphWeekend<-ggplot(StartEndTime%>%filter(Date=="2022-03-05"),
                      aes(x=timestamp, xend=EndTime, y=currentMode, yend=currentMode,color=sleepStatus,group=currentMode)) +
  geom_segment(aes(group = seq_along(timestamp)),size=5)+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Time")+
  ylab("Location")+
  ggtitle("An average weekend")+
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Sleep Status"))+
  facet_wrap(~participantId,nrow = 2)+
  transition_reveal(timestamp)
DailyGraphWeekend<-animate(DailyGraphWeekend,duration = 15)
DailyGraphWeekend

```

<b>Knowledge</b>
<ul>
<li>Part. 113 seems to be an extrovert kind of person spending most of the time during weekends outdoors.</li>
<li>Part. 320 on the other hand prefers Friday night over Saturday mornings. The city is popular for its night life and he may like to explore those </li>
<li> Part. 320 goes back home only when he is prepared to sleep. </li>
</ul>
<b>Wisdom: </b> Recreation seems to have a positive impact on the mental health of a person. Also it is not advisable to travel sleepy as it can prove to be fatal. 

This throws an interesting observation, how much do these participants prioritize recreational activities in a week compared to other activities such as travelling and visiting restaurants.

### Is it all work and no play?

#### Data cleaning

```{r}

        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 6))
daysactivity
```

<b>Knowledge</b>
<ul>
<li>Participant 113 focused more on refreshing herself during the weekends as it is evident from the analysis by opting for recreational activities.</li>
<li>Travelling can be a cumbersome task and since Part. 113 does not travel that much, as a result, she may get more time to focus at home and work.</li>

</ul>


<b>Wisdom</b> All work and no play makes Jack a dumb boy. It is necessary to do some recreational activity to refresh yourself and that could be the reason behind high joviality of 113

Now that we have seen that Part.113 spends more time at home and at work, can we observe a work life balance?

### Work-Life Balance

We can determine this by figuring out how much time part.113 and part.320 get to spend at home.

#### Data cleaning

1. Grouping the log by ParticipantId, Date and current Mode.

```{r}
DailyCurrentModeTime=StatusLogDetails%>%group_by(participantId,Date,currentMode)%>%
  summarise(Timespent=sum(TotalTime))%>%mutate(Month=zoo::as.yearmon(Date,"%Y %m"))
paged_table(DailyCurrentModeTime)
```

2. To create a candle stick graph, we will go on to calculate the following: 
<ul>
<li> Open Time Spent:Time spent on the activities at the <i>start of the month</i></li>
<li> Close Time Spent:Time spent on any of the activities at the <i>end of the month</i>.</li>
<li> High Time Spent: Most amount of time spent during the month.</li>
<li> Low Time Spent: Least amount of time spent during the month.</li>
</ul>
    
```{r}
Open=DailyCurrentModeTime%>%group_by(participantId,Month,currentMode)%>%
  filter(day(Date)==max(day(Date)))%>%
  group_by(participantId,Month,currentMode)%>%
  summarise(OpenTimeSpent=sum(Timespent))

Close=DailyCurrentModeTime%>%group_by(participantId,Month,currentMode)%>%
  filter(day(Date)==min(day(Date)))%>%
  group_by(participantId,Month,currentMode)%>%
  summarise(CloseTimeSpent=sum(Timespent))

High=DailyCurrentModeTime%>%group_by(participantId,Month,currentMode)%>%
                       summarise(HighTimespent=max(Timespent))

Low=DailyCurrentModeTime%>%group_by(participantId,Month,currentMode)%>%
                       summarise(LowTimespent=min(Timespent))


CandlestickData=left_join(High, Low, by= c('participantId'='participantId',
        'Month'='Month',
        'currentMode'='currentMode')) %>%
                left_join(., Open, by=c('participantId'='participantId',
        'Month'='Month',
        'currentMode'='currentMode'))%>% left_join(., Close, by=c('participantId'='participantId',
        'Month'='Month',
        'currentMode'='currentMode'))

paged_table(CandlestickData)
```


```{r}

CSD320 <- CandlestickData%>%mutate(MonthUpdated=as.factor(Month))%>%
  filter(participantId=="320" & currentMode=="AtHome") %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~MonthUpdated, type="candlestick",
          open=~OpenTimeSpent,close=~CloseTimeSpent,
          high=~HighTimespent,low=~LowTimespent) 
CSD113 <- CandlestickData%>%mutate(MonthUpdated=as.factor(Month))%>%
  filter(participantId=="113" & currentMode=="AtHome") %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~MonthUpdated, type="candlestick",
          open=~OpenTimeSpent,close=~CloseTimeSpent,
          high=~HighTimespent,low=~LowTimespent)

fig <- subplot(CSD320, CSD113,nrows=2,shareX=TRUE) %>% 
  layout(title = 'Time spent at home',annotations = list( 
  list( 
    x = 0.2,  
    y = 1.0,  
    text = "Participant Id: 320",  
    xref = "paper",  
    yref = "paper",  
    xanchor = "center",  
    yanchor = "bottom",  
    showarrow = FALSE 
  ),  
  list( 
    x = 0.2,  
    y = 0.5,  
    text = "Participant Id: 113",  
    xref = "paper",  
    yref = "paper",  
    xanchor = "center",  
    yanchor = "bottom",  
    showarrow = FALSE 
  )))
fig


```

<b>Knowledge</b>
<ul>
<li>Part. 113 seems to have spent a considerable amount of time which relates to a good work life balance. </li>
<li>The End of quarters seems to be a busy month for all</li>
</ul>

<b>Wisdom: </b>A good work life balance and spending quality time at home can lead to a better mental and physical health

### Are they sleeping enough?

We looked at the activities in an average day. We can now deep dive and explore how much have they been sleeping

#### Data Preparation

To create a heat map, we will determine the cut points by calculating the outliers, origin and scale. 

```{r}
cutpoints <- StatusLogDetails%>%group_by(participantId,Date,sleepStatus)%>%
                       summarise(Timespent=sum(TotalTime))%>%
                       filter(sleepStatus=="Sleeping")  %>% 
  mutate(
    outlier = between(
      Timespent, 
      quantile(Timespent, 0.25, na.rm=T)-
        1.5*IQR(Timespent, na.rm=T),
      quantile(Timespent, 0.75, na.rm=T)+
        1.5*IQR(Timespent, na.rm=T))) %>% 
  filter(outlier)

ori <- sum(range(cutpoints$Timespent))/2
sca <- seq(range(cutpoints$Timespent)[1], 
           range(cutpoints$Timespent)[2], 
           length.out = 7)[-4]
```

#### Visualization

```{r}
ggplot(StatusLogDetails%>%group_by(participantId,Date,sleepStatus)%>%
                       summarise(Timespent=sum(TotalTime))%>%
                       filter(sleepStatus=="Sleeping")) +
  geom_horizon(aes(Date,
                   Timespent,
                   fill = ..Cutpoints..), 
               origin = ori, horizonscale = sca) +
  scale_fill_hcl(palette = 'RdBu', reverse = T) +
  facet_grid(participantId~.) +
  theme_few() +
  theme(
    panel.spacing.y=unit(0, "lines"),
    strip.text.y = element_text(size = 7, angle = 0, hjust = 0),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7, angle = 90, hjust = 0)
    ) +
  scale_x_date(expand=c(0,0), 
               date_breaks = "1 month", 
               date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  xlab('Month') +
  ggtitle('How important is sleep?', 
          'Monitoring sleep duration for both the participants')

```

<b>Knowledge</b>
<ul>
<li>Clearly Part 113 prioritizes sleep the right amount. The graph suggests that she has been sleeping to stay awake, work and ensure a healthy life</li>
<li> Part. 320 can focus more on sleep which can lead to better joviality index</li>
</ul>

<b>Wisdom:</b> Right amount of sleep can lead to a happier and healthy life :)

### Can money turn a frown upside down?

Here we are going to study the effect of available balance on the participants over the months and figure if more money equals to a happier life.

#### Data Cleaning

Filtering out 3 months- Mar 2022, Dec 2022 and May 2023 to notice the effect of available balance. 

```{r}
df<-FilteredLog%>%mutate(Month=as.character(zoo::as.yearmon(timestamp,"%Y %m")))%>%
  group_by(participantId,Month)%>%
  filter(timestamp==max(timestamp))%>%
  filter(Month=="Mar 2022" |Month=="Dec 2022" |Month=="May 2023")%>%
  mutate(availableBalance=round(availableBalance,2))
paged_table(df)
```

#### Visualization

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = factor(Month,
                                 levels=c("Mar 2022","Dec 2022","May 2023")), 
                      y = availableBalance, 
                      group = participantId)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = participantId, alpha = 1), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(color = participantId, alpha = 1), size = 4) +
  geom_text_repel(data = df %>% filter(Month == "Mar 2022"), 
                  aes(label = paste0(participantId, " - ", availableBalance)) , 
                  hjust = "left", 
                  fontface = "bold", 
                  size = 4, 
                  nudge_x = -.45, 
                  direction = "y") +
  geom_text_repel(data = df %>% filter(Month == "May 2023"), 
                  aes(label = paste0(participantId, " - ", availableBalance)) , 
                  hjust = "right", 
                  fontface = "bold", 
                  size = 4, 
                  nudge_x = .5, 
                  direction = "y")+
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top")+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.border     = element_blank(),
  axis.title.y     = element_blank(),
  axis.text.y      = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
  axis.title.x     = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
  axis.text.x.top      = element_text(size=12),
  axis.ticks       = element_blank(),
  plot.title       = element_text(size=14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
  plot.subtitle    = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(
    title = "The rise/fall of balance",
    subtitle = "Available balance across months*",
    caption = "*The balance is captured on the last day of the said months"
  )

```

<b>Knowledge</b>
<ul>
<li> The available balance seems to be increasing over the months for both the participants. This aligns with our observation in the previous Take Home Exercise- the cost of living at Engagement is not that expensive and can be a great place for people to work and save.</li>
<li> Part. 320 clearly holds a better bank balance than Part. 113 over the months which tells us that Part. 320 seems to be more financially stable than 113. </li>
</ul>

<b>Wisdom:</b> It is not necessary that a better bank balance can lead to more jovial life. Healthy and balanced lifestyle plays a vital role.
